# labyrinth
Labyrinth is a text based game based on the series on board games designed by Max Kobbert for Ravensburger AG.

The objective of Labyrinth is to connect the two end tiles by sliding tiles in the maze-like board. Some tiles, however are fixed (marked by xs) and cannot be moved. 
Tiles consist of various shapes that can connect to other tiles in one of the four cardinal directions.
A move consists of choosing which row or column to move, and sliding that entire row or column across by one tile. 
The player always has one extra tile which is added into the board when making a move, and the tile that is 'pushed off' the board on the other end of the row or column becomes the new extra tile. 
Try to see how quickly you can connect the tiles!
